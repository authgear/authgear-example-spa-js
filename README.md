# Authgear sample for SPA (Single Page App)

This repo demonstrates how to add authentication into any JavaScript apps using Authgear.

## Project setup

1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies. 
2. Next, run `npm run dev` to start the application usingÂ `nodemon`, monitoring for changes as we modify files.

### Create Free Authgear Account
1. Goto [https://portal.authgear.com](https://portal.authgear.com) and create a free account (or login to your existing account).

2. Then navigate to Applications and create a new client application of type Single Page Application.

### Configuration

The project needs to be configured with your Authgear app's Endpoint and client ID in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, in `public/app.js`, replace these values with with your own Authgear application credentials:

```javascript
const AUTHGEAR_CLIENT_ID = "<CLIENT_ID>";
const AUTHGEAR_ENDPOINT = "<AUTHGEAR_ENDPOINT>";
```

Ensure that you add `http://localhost:3000/` as an Authorized Redirect URI in your Authgear Client Application.
